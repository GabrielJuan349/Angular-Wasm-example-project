1. Open a terminal where you had installed Rust
2. Execute the command `cargo install wasm-pack`
3. Go tho the rust-lib folder `cd project/wasm-code/src/lib/rust-lib`
4. Execute the command `wasm-pack build --target web`, if is the first time, or `wasm-pack build â€” target web`, if you had modified the library.
